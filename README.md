## Our Progress on Fixing the 404 Error in WASM Tests

We've been working on resolving the error `Error: http://127.0.0.1:xxxxx/session/[id]/url: status code 404` that occurs when running WASM tests with wasm-pack. This error happens because wasm-bindgen-test tries to access a URL that doesn't exist during test execution.

### Approaches We've Tried:

1. **Storage Mocking**: 
   - Created a mock localStorage implementation to prevent real localStorage operations
   - Implemented functions like `mock_local_storage_get`, `mock_local_storage_set`, and `mock_local_storage_clear`
   - This avoided blocking operations but didn't resolve the 404 error

2. **Test Setup Module**:
   - Created a `test_setup.rs` module with initialization functions
   - Added `wait_for_dom_update()` to handle asynchronous operations safely
   - Implemented better error handling for DOM operations

3. **Improved Test Utils**:
   - Enhanced the `get_by_test_id()` function with better error reporting
   - Created safer event handling in `click_and_wait()`
   - Added helper functions for waiting for elements to appear

4. **Direct JavaScript URL Interception**:
   - Created a `direct_patch.js` file to intercept problematic URL requests
   - Used a custom test harness HTML file (`test-harness.html`)
   - Added fetch and XMLHttpRequest interception for URLs containing `/session/` and `/url`

5. **Rust-based XHR Patching**:
   - Added a `mock_xhr.rs` module that applies JavaScript patches from Rust
   - Used the `wasm_bindgen(start)` attribute to apply patches early
   - Created test methods to verify the patch works

6. **Run Script Approach**:
   - Created a `run-test.sh` script that sets up the environment and runs tests
   - Used environment variables to inject the patch before tests run
   - Targeted specific tests to verify the patch works

7. **Cargo.toml Configuration**:
   - Added `[package.metadata.wasm-pack]` section to specify custom test HTML
   - Updated dependencies to include `wasm-bindgen-futures = "0.4.50"` and other required crates
   - Added appropriate web-sys features for browser interactions

### Current Status:

The issue appears to be persistent despite our attempts to intercept the problematic URL requests. The most promising approach seems to be the direct JavaScript patch combined with specifying a custom test harness in Cargo.toml, but we haven't yet confirmed that it resolves the issue completely.

### Next Steps:

1. Verify if the most direct approach (using the run script) works
2. If none of our approaches work, we may need to:
   - Consider running tests in a different browser
   - Explore using a different test runner
   - Look into updating dependencies or changing the overall test architecture
   - Check if there's a known issue or workaround in newer versions of wasm-pack or wasm-bindgen-test

This summary should help us avoid repeating the same approaches in future conversations while we continue working toward a solution.
